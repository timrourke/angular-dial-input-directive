# Angular 1.x Resizable Ellipse Directive

This directive is a simple modification of the [draggable element directive example](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/compiler#directive) shown in Angular 1.x's documentation. It provides an isolate scope directive that offers two-way binding to its dimensional values via the directive's attributes.
